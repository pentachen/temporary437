This is a basic message board where people must first login in order to view the global stream of posts.  If a person does not have an account, then they must first register in order to access the message board.  The global stream of posts is listed in reverse chronological order.  Clicking on a user's name (listed underneath their post) will display their profile, which consists of their Username, First_Name, Last_Name, and a reverse-chronological-order list of all their posts.  Users can use the Sign Out button in the top right to sign out.

An edit profile page, where users can add a bio, a birthday, and a profile picture.
A followers-only button in the top right of the global stream page, which users can use to toggle which posts are viewable.
Users can now follow and unfollow other users by going to their profiles and clicking the corresponding button underneath their photo.
Clicking on the username underneath the post box links to your own profile as well.
